## Introduction

Input data format: { } = optional, [ ] = it depends, | = or
All quantities whose dimensions are not explicitly specified are in
RYDBERG ATOMIC UNITS. Charge is "number" charge (i.e. not multiplied
by e); potentials are in energy units (i.e. they are multiplied by e).
BEWARE: TABS, CRLF, ANY OTHER STRANGE CHARACTER, ARE A SOURCES OF TROUBLE
USE ONLY PLAIN ASCII TEXT FILES (CHECK THE FILE TYPE WITH UNIX COMMAND "file")
Namelists must appear in the order given below.
Comment lines in namelists can be introduced by a "!", exactly as in
fortran code. Comments lines in cards can be introduced by
either a "!" or a "#" character in the first position of a line.
Do not start any line in cards with a "/" character.
Leave a space between card names and card options, e.g.
ATOMIC_POSITIONS (bohr), not ATOMIC_POSITIONS(bohr)

calculation
Default:

## Character

'scf'
A string describing the task to be performed. Options are:
'scf'
'nscf'
'bands'
'relax'
'md'
'vc-relax'
'vc-md'
(vc = variable-cell).
title
Default:

## Character

' '
reprinted on output.
verbosity

## Character

Default:
'low'
Currently two verbosity levels are implemented:
'high'
'low'
'debug' and 'medium' have the same effect as 'high';
'default' and 'minimal' as 'low'
restart_mode
Default:

## Character

'from_scratch'
 Available options are:
'from_scratch' :
From scratch. This is the normal way to perform a PWscf calculation
'restart' :
From previous interrupted run. Use this switch only if you want to
continue, using the same number of processors and parallelization,
an interrupted calculation. Do not use to start a new one, or to
perform a non-scf calculations.  Works only if the calculation was
cleanly stopped using variable max_seconds, or by user request

"outdir"; see variables prefix, outdir). The default for
startingwfc and startingpot is set to 'file'.
wf_collect

## Logical

 OBSOLETE - NO LONGER IMPLEMENTED
nstep

## Integer

Default: 1 if calculation == 'scf', 'nscf', 'bands'; 50 for the other cases
number of molecular-dynamics or structural optimization steps
performed in this run. If set to 0, the code performs a quick
"dry run", stopping just after initialization. This is useful
to check for input correctness and to have the summary printed.
NOTE: in MD calculations, the code will perform "nstep" steps
even if restarting from a previously interrupted calculation.
iprint

## Integer

Default: write only at convergence
When calculation == 'md' (molecular dynamics)
trajectory is written every iprint md steps.
tstress
Default:

## Logical

.false.
calculate stress. It is set to .TRUE. automatically if
calculation == 'vc-md' or 'vc-relax'
tprnfor

## Logical

calculate forces. It is set to .TRUE. automatically if
calculation == 'relax','md','vc-md'
dt
REAL
Default: 20.D0
time step for molecular dynamics, in Rydberg atomic units
(1 a.u.=4.8378 * 10^-17 s : beware, the CP code uses
 Hartree atomic units, half that much!!!)

This directory specifies where to store files generated by
each processor (*.wfc{N}, *.igk{N}, etc.). Useful for
machines without a parallel file system: set wfcdir to
a local file system, while outdir should be a parallel
or network file system, visible to all processors. Beware:

## Obsolete - No Longer Implemented

max_seconds
REAL
Default: 1.D+7, or 150 days, i.e. no time limit
Jobs stops after max_seconds CPU time. Use this option
in conjunction with option restart_mode if you need to
split a job too long to complete into shorter jobs that
fit into your batch queues.
etot_conv_thr
REAL
Default: 1.0D-4
Convergence threshold on total energy (a.u) for ionic
minimization: the convergence criterion is satisfied
when the total energy changes less than etot_conv_thr
between two consecutive scf steps. Note that etot_conv_thr
is extensive, like the total energy.
See also forc_conv_thr - both criteria must be satisfied
forc_conv_thr
REAL
Default: 1.0D-3
Convergence threshold on forces (a.u) for ionic minimization:
the convergence criterion is satisfied when all components of
all forces are smaller than forc_conv_thr.
See also etot_conv_thr - both criteria must be satisfied
disk_io

## Character

Default:
see below
Specifies the amount of disk I/O activity:
(only for binary files and xml data file in data directory;
other files printed at each molecular dynamics / structural
optimization step are not controlled by this option )
'high' :
save charge to disk at each SCF step,
keep wavefunctions on disk (in "distributed" format),
save mixing data as well.
Do not use this option unless you have a good reason!
It is no longer needed to specify 'high' in order to be able
to restart from an interrupted calculation (see restart_mode)
'medium' :
save charge to disk at each SCF step,
keep wavefunctions on disk only if more than one k-point,
per process is present, otherwise keep them in memory;
save them to disk only at the end (in "portable" format)
'low' :
save charge to disk at each SCF step,
keep wavefunctions in memory (for all k-points),
save them to disk only at the end (in "portable" format).

pw.x: input description
Reduces I/O but increases memory wrt the previous cases
'nowf' :
save to disk only the xml data file and the charge density
at convergence, never save wavefunctions. Restarting from
an interrupted calculation is not possible with this option.
'minimal' :
save to disk only the xml data file at convergence
'none' :
do not save anything to disk
Default is 'low' for the scf case, 'medium' otherwise.
Note that the needed RAM increases as disk I/O decreases
pseudo_dir

## Character

Default:
value of the $ESPRESSO_PSEUDO environment variable if set;
'$HOME/espresso/pseudo/' otherwise
directory containing pseudopotential files
tefield
Default:

## Logical

.FALSE.
If .TRUE. a saw-like potential simulating an electric field
is added to the bare ionic potential. See variables edir,
eamp, emaxpos, eopreg for the form and size of
the added potential.
dipfield

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
If .TRUE. and tefield==.TRUE. a dipole correction is also
added to the bare ionic potential - implements the recipe
of L. Bengtsson, PRB 59, 12301 (1999). See variables edir,
emaxpos, eopreg for the form of the correction. Must
be used ONLY in a slab geometry, for surface calculations,
with the discontinuity FALLING IN THE EMPTY SPACE.
lelfield

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
If .TRUE. a homogeneous finite electric field described
through the modern theory of the polarization is applied.
This is different from tefield == .true. !
nberrycyc

## Integer

Default: 1
In the case of a finite electric field  ( lelfield == .TRUE. )
it defines the number of iterations for converging the
wavefunctions in the electric field Hamiltonian, for each
external iteration on the charge density

lberry

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
If .TRUE. perform a Berry phase calculation.
See the header of PW/src/bp_c_phase.f90 for documentation.
gdir

## Integer

For Berry phase calculation: direction of the k-point
strings in reciprocal space. Allowed values: 1, 2, 3
1=first, 2=second, 3=third reciprocal lattice vector
For calculations with finite electric fields
(lelfield==.true.) "gdir" is the direction of the field.
nppstr

## Integer

For Berry phase calculation: number of k-points to be
calculated along each symmetry-reduced string.
The same for calculation with finite electric fields
(lelfield==.true.).
gate

## Logical

Default:
See:
.FALSE.
zgate, relaxz, block, block_1, block_2, block_height
In the case of charged cells (tot_charge .ne. 0) setting gate = .TRUE.
represents the counter charge (i.e. -tot_charge) not by a homogeneous
background charge but with a charged plate, which is placed at zgate
(see below). Details of the gate potential can be found in
T. Brumme, M. Calandra, F. Mauri; PRB 89, 245406 (2014).
Note, that in systems which are not symmetric with respect to the plate,
one needs to enable the dipole correction! (dipfield=.true.).
Currently, symmetry can be used with gate=.true. but carefully check
that no symmetry is included which maps z to -z even if in principle one
could still use them for symmetric systems (i.e. no dipole correction).
For nosym=.false. verbosity is set to 'high'.
Note: this option was called "monopole" in v6.0 and 6.1 of pw.x
twochem

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
See: nelec_cond, nbnd_cond, degauss_cond
IF .TRUE. , a two chemical potential calculation for the simulation of
photoexcited systems is performed, constraining a fraction of the
electrons in the conduction manifold.
See G. Marini, M. Calandra; PRB 104, 144103 (2021).
Note: requires occupations to be set to 'smearing'.
lfcp

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
If .TRUE. perform a constant bias potential (constant-mu) calculation
for a system with ESM method. See the header of PW/src/fcp_module.f90
for documentation. To perform the calculation, you must set a namelist FCP.
NB:
- The total energy displayed in output includes the potentiostat
  contribution (-mu*N).
- calculation must be 'relax' or 'md'.
- assume_isolated = 'esm' and esm_bc = 'bc2' or 'bc3' must be set

  in SYSTEM namelist.
- ESM-RISM is also supported (assume_isolated = 'esm' and esm_bc = 'bc1'
  and trism = .TRUE.).
- ignore_wolfe is always .TRUE., for BFGS.
trism

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
If .TRUE. perform a 3D-RISM-SCF calculation
[for details see H.Sato et al., JCP 112, 9463 (2000), doi:10.1063/1.481564].
The solvent's distributions are calculated by 3D-RISM,
though solute is treated as SCF. The charge density and
the atomic positions are optimized, simultaneously with
the solvents. To perform the calculation, you must set
a namelist RISM and a card SOLVENTS.
If assume_isolated = 'esm' and esm_bc = 'bc1',
Laue-RISM is calculated instead of 3D-RISM
and coupled with ESM method (i.e. ESM-RISM).
[for details see S.Nishihara and M.Otani, PRB 96, 115429 (2017)].
The default of mixing_beta is 0.2
for both 3D-RISM and Laue-RISM.
For structural relaxation with BFGS,
ignore_wolfe is always .TRUE. .

tot_charge
REAL
Default: 0.0
Total charge of the system. Useful for simulations with charged cells.
By default the unit cell is assumed to be neutral (tot_charge=0).
tot_charge=+1 means one electron missing from the system,
tot_charge=-1 means one additional electron, and so on.
In a periodic calculation a compensating jellium background is
inserted to remove divergences if the cell is not neutral.
starting_charge(i), i=1,ntyp REAL
Default: 0.0
starting charge on atomic type 'i',
to create starting potential with startingpot = 'atomic'.
tot_magnetization REAL
Default:
-10000 [unspecified]
Total majority spin charge - minority spin charge.
Used to impose a specific total electronic magnetization.
If unspecified then tot_magnetization variable is ignored and
the amount of electronic magnetization is determined during
the self-consistent cycle.
starting_magnetization(i), i=1,ntyp REAL
Default: 0
Starting spin polarization on atomic type 'i' in a spin-polarized
(LSDA or non-collinear/spin-orbit) calculation.
The input values can have an absolute value greater than or equal to 1,
which will be interpreted as the site's magnetic moment.
Alternatively, the values can range between -1 and 1,
which will be interpreted as the site magnetization per valence electron.
For QE-v7.2 and older versions, only the second option is allowed.
If you expect a nonzero magnetization in your ground state,
        you MUST either specify a nonzero value for at least one
        atomic type, or constrain the magnetization using variable
        tot_magnetization for LSDA, constrained_magnetization
        for noncollinear/spin-orbit calculations. If you don't,
        you will get a nonmagnetic (zero magnetization) state.
In order to perform LSDA calculations for an antiferromagnetic
        state, define two different atomic species corresponding to
        sublattices of the same atomic type.
NOTE 1: starting_magnetization is ignored in most BUT NOT ALL
        cases in non-scf calculations: it is safe to keep the same
        values for the scf and subsequent non-scf calculation.
        NOTE 2: If you fix the magnetization with
        tot_magnetization, do not specify starting_magnetization.
        NOTE 3: In the noncollinear/spin-orbit case, starting with zero
starting_magnetization on all atoms imposes time reversal
symmetry. The magnetization is never calculated and is
        set to zero (the internal variable domag is set to .FALSE.).

kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for wavefunctions
ecutrho
REAL
Default: 4 * ecutwfc
Kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for charge density and potential
For norm-conserving pseudopotential you should stick to the
default value, you can reduce it by a little but it will
introduce noise especially on forces and stress.
If there are ultrasoft PP, a larger value than the default is
often desirable (ecutrho = 8 to 12 times ecutwfc, typically).
PAW datasets can often be used at 4*ecutwfc, but it depends
on the shape of augmentation charge: testing is mandatory.
The use of gradient-corrected functional, especially in cells
with vacuum, or for pseudopotential without non-linear core
correction, usually requires an higher values of ecutrho
to be accurately converged.
ecutfock
REAL
Default: ecutrho
Kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for the exact exchange operator in
EXX type calculations. By default this is the same as ecutrhorho
but in some EXX calculations, a significant speed-up can be obtained
by reducing ecutfock, at the expense of some loss in accuracy.
Must be .gt. ecutwfc. Not implemented for stress calculation
and for US-PP and PAW pseudopotentials.
Use with care, especially in metals where it may give raise
to instabilities.
nr1, nr2, nr3

## Integer

Three-dimensional FFT mesh (hard grid) for charge
density (and scf potential). If not specified
the grid is calculated based on the cutoff for
charge density (see also ecutrhorho)
Note: you must specify all three dimensions for this setting to
be used.
nr1s, nr2s, nr3s

## Integer

Three-dimensional mesh for wavefunction FFT and for the smooth
part of charge density ( smooth grid ).
Coincides with nr1, nr2, nr3 if ecutrhorho = 4 * ecutwfc ( default )
Note: you must specify all three dimensions for this setting to
be used.
nosym

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
if (.TRUE.) symmetry is not used. Consequences:
- if a list of k points is provided in input, it is used
  "as is": symmetry-inequivalent k-points are not generated,
  and the charge density is not symmetrized;
- if a uniform (Monkhorst-Pack) k-point grid is provided in
  input, it is expanded to cover the entire Brillouin Zone,
  irrespective of the crystal symmetry.
  Time reversal symmetry is assumed so k and -k are considered
  as equivalent unless noinv=.true. is specified.
Do not use this option unless you know exactly what you want
and what you get. May be useful in the following cases:
- in low-symmetry large cells, if you cannot afford a k-point
  grid with the correct symmetry
- in MD simulations

nosym_evc

## Logical

Default:
.FALSE.
if (.TRUE.) symmetry is not used, and k points are
forced to have the symmetry of the Bravais lattice;
an automatically generated Monkhorst-Pack grid will contain
all points of the grid over the entire Brillouin Zone,
plus the points rotated by the symmetries of the Bravais
lattice which were not in the original grid. The same
applies if a k-point list is provided in input instead
of a Monkhorst-Pack grid. Time reversal symmetry is assumed
so k and -k are equivalent unless noinv=.true. is specified.
This option differs from nosym because it forces k-points
in all cases to have the full symmetry of the Bravais lattice
(not all uniform grids have such property!)
noinv
Default:

## Logical

.FALSE.
if (.TRUE.) disable the usage of k => -k symmetry
(time reversal) in k-point generation
no_t_rev
Default:

## Logical

.FALSE.
if (.TRUE.) disable the usage of magnetic symmetry operations
that consist in a rotation + time reversal.
force_symmorphic LOGICAL
Default:
.FALSE.
if (.TRUE.) force the symmetry group to be symmorphic by disabling
symmetry operations having an associated fractionary translation
use_all_frac
Default:

## Logical

.FALSE.
if (.FALSE.) force real-space FFT grids to be commensurate with
fractionary translations of non-symmorphic symmetry operations,
if present (e.g.: if a fractional translation (0,0,c/4) exists,
the FFT dimension along the c axis must be multiple of 4).
if (.TRUE.) do not impose any constraints to FFT grids, even in
the presence of non-symmorphic symmetry operations.
BEWARE: use_all_frac=.TRUE. may lead to wrong results for
hybrid functionals and phonon calculations. Both cases use
symmetrization in real space that works for non-symmorphic
operations only if the real-space FFT grids are commensurate.

'fixed' :

'from_input' :
The occupation are read from input file,
card OCCUPATIONS. Option valid only for a
single k-point, requires nbnd to be set
in input. Occupations should be consistent
with the value of tot_charge.
one_atom_occupations LOGICAL
Default:
.FALSE.
This flag is used for isolated atoms (nat=1) together with
occupations='from_input'. If it is .TRUE., the wavefunctions
are ordered as the atomic starting wavefunctions, independently
from their eigenvalue. The occupations indicate which atomic
states are filled.
The order of the states is written inside the UPF pseudopotential file.
In the scalar relativistic case:
S -> l=0, m=0
P -> l=1, z, x, y
D -> l=2, r^2-3z^2, xz, yz, xy, x^2-y^2
In the noncollinear magnetic case (with or without spin-orbit),
each group of states is doubled. For instance:
P -> l=1, z, x, y for spin up, l=1, z, x, y for spin down.
Up and down is relative to the direction of the starting
magnetization.
In the case with spin-orbit and time-reversal
(starting_magnetization=0.0) the atomic wavefunctions are
radial functions multiplied by spin-angle functions.
For instance:
P -> l=1, j=1/2, m_j=-1/2,1/2. l=1, j=3/2,
     m_j=-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.
In the magnetic case with spin-orbit the atomic wavefunctions
can be forced to be spin-angle functions by setting
starting_spin_angle to .TRUE..
starting_spin_angle LOGICAL
Default:
.FALSE.
In the spin-orbit case when domag=.TRUE., by default,
the starting wavefunctions are initialized as in scalar
relativistic noncollinear case without spin-orbit.
By setting starting_spin_angle=.TRUE. this behaviour can
be changed and the initial wavefunctions are radial
functions multiplied by spin-angle functions.
When domag=.FALSE. the initial wavefunctions are always
radial functions multiplied by spin-angle functions
independently from this flag.
When lspinorb is .FALSE. this flag is not used.

nqx1, nqx2, nqx3

## Integer

Three-dimensional mesh for q (k1-k2) sampling of
the Fock operator (EXX). Can be smaller than
the number of k-points.
Currently this defaults to the size of the k-point mesh used.
In QE =< 5.0.2 it defaulted to nqx1=nqx2=nqx3=1.
localization_thr
REAL
Default: 0.0
Overlap threshold over which the exchange integral over a pair of localized orbitals
is included in the evaluation of EXX operator. Any value greater than 0.0 triggers
the SCDM localization and the evaluation on EXX using the localized orbitals.
Very small value of the threshold should yield the same result as the default EXX
evaluation
Hubbard_occ(ityp,i), (ityp,i) = (1,1) . . . (ntyp,3) REAL
Default:
read from pseudopotentials
Hubbard occupations is the number of electrons in the
Hubbard manifold. By default they are initialized by
reading the occupations from pseudopotentials. If specified
from the input, then the values read from the pseudopotentials
will be overwritten.
The second index of the Hubbard_occ array corresponds to the
Hubbard manifold number. It is possible to specify up to
three Hubbard manifolds per Hubbard atom. However, if you want
to specify three manifolds then the second and the third manifolds
will be considered as one effective manifold (see Doc/Hubbard_input.pdf)
Hubbard_beta(i), i=1,ntyp REAL
Default: 0.D0 for all species
Hubbard_beta(i) is the perturbation (on atom i, in eV)
used to compute J0 with the linear-response method of
Cococcioni and de Gironcoli, PRB 71, 035105 (2005)

For the noncollinear case, the ispin index runs up to npol=2
The value lmax  is given by the maximum angular momentum
number to which the Hubbard U is applied.
Leave unchanged eigenvalues that are not set.
This is useful to suggest the desired orbital occupations
when the default choice takes another path.

- dft_update/delta_N with dimension [number of k-points, number of correlated orbitals,
number of correlated orbitals, 2 (real + complex)]
ensemble_energies LOGICAL
Default:
.false.
If ensemble_energies = .true., an ensemble of xc energies
is calculated non-selfconsistently for perturbed
exchange-enhancement factors and LDA vs. PBE correlation
ratios after each converged electronic ground state
calculation.
Ensemble energies can be analyzed with the 'bee' utility
included with libbeef.
Requires linking against libbeef.
input_dft must be set to a BEEF-type functional
(e.g. input_dft = 'BEEF-vdW')
edir

## Integer

The direction of the electric field or dipole correction is
parallel to the bg(:,edir) reciprocal lattice vector, so the
potential is constant in planes defined by FFT grid points;
edir = 1, 2 or 3. Used only if tefield is .TRUE.
emaxpos
REAL
Default: 0.5D0
Position of the maximum of the saw-like potential along crystal
axis edir, within the  unit cell (see below), 0 < emaxpos < 1
Used only if tefield is .TRUE.
eopreg
REAL
Default: 0.1D0
Zone in the unit cell where the saw-like potential decreases.
( see below, 0 < eopreg < 1 ). Used only if tefield is .TRUE.
eamp
REAL
Default: 0.001 a.u.
Amplitude of the electric field, in ***Hartree*** a.u.;
1 a.u. = 51.4220632*10^10 V/m. Used only if tefield==.TRUE.
The saw-like potential increases with slope eamp in the
region from (emaxpos+eopreg-1) to (emaxpos), then decreases
to 0 until (emaxpos+eopreg), in units of the crystal
vector edir. Important: the change of slope of this
potential must be located in the empty region, or else
unphysical forces will result.
angle1(i), i=1,ntyp REAL

magnetization and the z-axis. For noncollinear calculations
only; index i runs over the atom types.

file from a collinear lsda calculation assumes previous density points in
z direction and rotates it in the direction described by angle1 and

constrained_magnetization CHARACTER
Default:
See:
'none'
lambda, fixed_magnetization
Used to perform constrained calculations in magnetic systems.
Currently available choices:
'none' :
no constraint
'total' :
total magnetization is constrained by
adding a penalty functional to the total energy:
LAMBDA * SUM_{i} ( magnetization(i) - fixed_magnetization(i) )**2
where the sum over i runs over the three components of
the magnetization. Lambda is a real number (see below).
Noncolinear case only. Use tot_magnetization for LSDA
'atomic' :
atomic magnetization are constrained to the defined
starting magnetization adding a penalty:
LAMBDA * SUM_{i,itype} ( magnetic_moment(i,itype) - mcons(i,itype) )**2
where i runs over the cartesian components (or just z
in the collinear case) and itype over the types (1-ntype).
mcons(:,:) array is defined from starting_magnetization,
(also from angle1, angle2 in the noncollinear case).
lambda is a real number
'total direction' :
the angle theta of the total magnetization
with the z axis (theta = fixed_magnetization(3))
is constrained:
LAMBDA * ( arccos(magnetization(3)/mag_tot) - theta )**2
where mag_tot is the modulus of the total magnetization.
'atomic direction' :
not all the components of the atomic
magnetic moment are constrained but only the cosine
of angle1, and the penalty functional is:
LAMBDA * SUM_{itype} ( mag_mom(3,itype)/mag_mom_tot - cos(angle1(ityp)) )**2
N.B.: symmetrization may prevent to reach the desired orientation
of the magnetization. Try not to start with very highly symmetric
configurations or use the nosym flag (only as a last remedy)

report =-1  at the beginning of the scf and at convergence
        report = N  as -1, plus every N scf iterations
lspinorb

## Logical

if .TRUE. the noncollinear code can use a pseudopotential with
spin-orbit.
assume_isolated
Default:

## Character

'none'
Used to perform calculation assuming the system to be
isolated (a molecule or a cluster in a 3D supercell).
Currently available choices:
'none' :
(default): regular periodic calculation w/o any correction.
'makov-payne', 'm-p', 'mp' :
the Makov-Payne correction to the
total energy is computed. An estimate of the vacuum
level is also calculated so that eigenvalues can be
properly aligned. ONLY FOR CUBIC SYSTEMS (ibrav=1,2,3).
Theory: G.Makov, and M.C.Payne,
     "Periodic boundary conditions in ab initio
     calculations" , PRB 51, 4014 (1995).
'martyna-tuckerman', 'm-t', 'mt' :
Martyna-Tuckerman correction
to both total energy and scf potential. Adapted from:
G.J. Martyna, and M.E. Tuckerman,
"A reciprocal space based method for treating long
range interactions in ab-initio and force-field-based
calculation in clusters", J. Chem. Phys. 110, 2810 (1999),
doi:10.1063/1.477923.
'esm' :
Effective Screening Medium Method.
For polarized or charged slab calculation, embeds
the simulation cell within an effective semi-
infinite medium in the perpendicular direction
(along z). Embedding regions can be vacuum or
semi-infinite metal electrodes (use esm_bc to
choose boundary conditions). If between two
electrodes, an optional electric field
(esm_efield) may be applied. Method described in
M. Otani and O. Sugino, "First-principles calculations
of charged surfaces and interfaces: A plane-wave
nonrepeated slab approach", PRB 73, 115407 (2006).
NB:
   - Two dimensional (xy plane) average charge density
     and electrostatic potentials are printed out to

pw.x: input description
     'prefix.esm1'.
   - Requires cell with a_3 lattice vector along z,
     normal to the xy plane, with the slab centered
     around z=0.
   - For bc2 with an electric field and bc3 boundary
     conditions, the inversion symmetry along z-direction
     is automatically eliminated.
   - In case of calculation='vc-relax', use
     cell_dofree='2Dxy' or other parameters so that
     c-vector along z-axis should not be moved.
See esm_bc, esm_efield, esm_w, esm_nfit.
'2D' :
Truncation of the Coulomb interaction in the z direction
for structures periodic in the x-y plane. Total energy,
forces and stresses are computed in a two-dimensional framework.
Linear-response calculations () done on top of a self-consistent
calculation with this flag will automatically be performed in
the 2D framework as well. Please refer to:
Sohier, T., Calandra, M., & Mauri, F. (2017), "Density functional
perturbation theory for gated two-dimensional heterostructures:
Theoretical developments and application to flexural phonons in graphene",
PRB, 96, 075448 (2017).
NB:
   - The length of the unit-cell along the z direction should
     be larger than twice the thickness of the 2D material
     (including electrons). A reasonable estimate for a
     layer's thickness could be the interlayer distance in the
     corresponding layered bulk material. Otherwise,
     the atomic thickness + 10 bohr should be a safe estimate.
     There is also a lower limit of 20 bohr imposed by the cutoff
     radius used to read pseudopotentials (see read_pseudo.f90 in Modules).
   - As for ESM above, only in-plane stresses make sense and one
     should use cell_dofree= '2Dxy' in a vc-relax calculation.

Default:

## Logical

.FALSE.
This keyword is useful when simulating the dynamics and/or the
thermodynamics of an isolated system. If set to true the total
torque of the internal forces is set to zero by adding new forces
that compensate the spurious interaction with the periodic
images. This allows for the use of smaller supercells.
BEWARE: since the potential energy is no longer consistent with
the forces (it still contains the spurious interaction with the
repeated images), the total energy is not conserved anymore.
However the dynamical and thermodynamical properties should be
in closer agreement with those of an isolated system.
Also the final energy of a structural relaxation will be higher,
but the relaxation itself should be faster.

Default: 0
specifies which thermostat group to use for given atomic type
when >0 assigns all the atoms in this type to thermostat
labeled nhgrp(i), when =0 each atom in the type gets its own
thermostat. Finally, when <0, then this atomic type will have
temperature "not controlled". Example: HCOOLi, with types H (1), C(2), O(3), Li(4);
setting nhgrp={2 2 0 -1} will add a common thermostat for both H & C,
one thermostat per each O (2 in total), and a non-updated thermostat
for Li which will effectively make temperature for Li "not controlled"
fnhscl(i), i=1,ntyp REAL

these are the scaling factors to be used together with nhptyp=3 and nhgrp(i)
in order to take care of possible reduction in the degrees of freedom due to

constrained. Then, these 2 atoms will have 5 degrees of freedom in total instead
of 6, and one can set fnhscl={5/6 5/6 1. 1.}. This way the target kinetic energy

tolp

Tolerance for velocity rescaling. Velocities are rescaled if
the run-averaged and target temperature differ more than tolp.
delta_t

The instantaneous temperature is calculated at the end of
every ionic move and BEFORE rescaling. This is the temperature
reported in the main output.
For delta_t < 0, the actual average rate of heating or cooling

               with any other one by specifying "ibrav+option". Please note that some
               combinations do not make sense for some crystals and will guarantee that
               the relax will never converge. E.g. 'ibrav+2Dxy' is not a problem for
               hexagonal cells, but will never converge for cubic ones.

REAL
Default: delta_t

FCP's move and BEFORE rescaling. This is the temperature
reported in the main output.

REAL
atomic positions
NOTE: each atomic coordinate can also be specified as a simple algebraic expression.
      To be interpreted correctly expression must NOT contain any blank
      space and must NOT start with a "+" sign. The available expressions are:
        + (plus), - (minus), / (division), * (multiplication), ^ (power)
      All numerical constants included are considered as double-precision numbers;
      i.e. 1/2 is 0.5, not zero. Other functions, such as sin, sqrt or exp are
      not available, although sqrt can be replaced with ^(1/2).
      Example:
            C  1/3   1/2*3^(-1/2)   0
      is equivalent to
            C  0.333333  0.288675  0.000000
      Please note that this feature is NOT supported by XCrysDen (which will
      display a wrong structure, or nothing at all).
      When atomic positions are of type crystal_sg coordinates can be given
      in the following four forms (Wyckoff positions):
         C  1a
         C  8g   x
         C  24m  x y
         C  48n  x y z
      The first form must be used when the Wyckoff letter determines uniquely
      all three coordinates, forms 2,3,4 when the Wyckoff letter and 1,2,3
      coordinates respectively are needed.
      The forms:
         C 8g  x  x  x

K_POINTS options are:
tpiba :
read k-points in cartesian coordinates,
in units of 2 pi/a (default)
automatic :
automatically generated uniform grid of k-points, i.e,
generates ( nk1, nk2, nk3 ) grid with ( sk1, sk2, sk3 ) offset.
nk1, nk2, nk3 as in Monkhorst-Pack grids
k1, k2, k3 must be 0 ( no offset ) or 1 ( grid displaced
by half a grid step in the corresponding direction )
BEWARE: only grids having the full symmetry of the crystal
        work with tetrahedra. Some grids with offset may not work.

crystal :
read k-points in crystal coordinates, i.e. in relative
coordinates of the reciprocal lattice vectors
gamma :
use k = 0 (no need to list k-point specifications after card)
In this case wavefunctions can be chosen as real,
and specialized subroutines optimized for calculations
at the gamma point are used (memory and cpu requirements
are reduced by approximately one half).
tpiba_b :
Used for band-structure plots.
See Doc/brillouin_zones.pdf for usage of BZ labels;
otherwise, k-points are in units of  2 pi/a.
nks points specify nks-1 lines in reciprocal space.
Every couple of points identifies the initial and
final point of a line. pw.x generates N intermediate
points of the line where N is the weight of the first point.
crystal_b :
As tpiba_b, but k-points are in crystal coordinates.
See Doc/brillouin_zones.pdf for usage of BZ labels.
tpiba_c :
Used for band-structure contour plots.
k-points are in units of  2 pi/a. nks must be 3.
3 k-points k_0, k_1, and k_2 specify a rectangle
in reciprocal space of vertices k_0, k_1, k_2,
k_1 + k_2 - k_0: k_0 + \alpha (k_1-k_0)+
\beta (k_2-k_0) with 0 <\alpha,\beta < 1.
The code produces a uniform mesh n1 x n2
k points in this rectangle. n1 and n2 are
the weights of k_1 and k_2. The weight of k_0
is not used.
crystal_c :
As tpiba_c, but k-points are in crystal coordinates.
nks

## Integer

 Number of supplied special k-points.
xk_x, xk_y, xk_z, wk REAL
Special k-points (xk_x/y/z) in the irreducible Brillouin Zone
(IBZ) of the lattice (with all symmetries) and weights (wk)
See the literature for lists of special points and
the corresponding weights.
If the symmetry is lower than the full symmetry
of the lattice, additional points with appropriate
weights are generated. Notice that such procedure
assumes that ONLY k-points in the IBZ are provided in input
In a non-scf calculation, weights do not affect the results.
If you just need eigenvalues and eigenvectors (for instance,
for a band-structure plot), weights can be set to any value
(for instance all equal to 1).
nk1, nk2, nk3

## Integer

These parameters specify the k-point grid
(nk1 x nk2 x nk3) as in Monkhorst-Pack grids.
sk1, sk2, sk3

## Integer

The grid offsets;  sk1, sk2, sk3 must be
0 ( no offset ) or 1 ( grid displaced by

Card's options:
atomic | ortho-atomic | norm-atomic | wf | pseudo
HUBBARD options are:
atomic :
use atomic orbitals (read from pseudopotential) to build the
Hubbard projectors
ortho-atomic :
use Lowdin orthogonalized atomic orbitals. This option is
recommended to be used whenever possible instead of atomic
because it allows to avoid applying Hubbard corrections twice
in the orbital overlap regions.
norm-atomic :
Lowdin normalization of atomic orbitals. Keep in mind:
atomic orbitals are not orthogonalized in this case.
This is a "quick and dirty" trick to be used when
atomic orbitals from the pseudopotential are not
normalized (and thus produce occupation whose
value exceeds unity).

pseudo :
use the pseudopotential projectors. The charge density
outside the atomic core radii is excluded.
N.B.: for atoms with +U, a pseudopotential with the

U             = string constant "U"; indicates the specs for a U parameter will be given
label         = label of the atom (as defined in ATOMIC_SPECIES)
shell         = specs of the nl-subshell (e.g., 3d, 2p...)
u_val         = value of the U parameter (in eV)
eigenstate(m) = index/indices of the m-th eigenstate(s) belonging to the shell
                   that will be targeted by U corrections (see below)
Syntax of the eigenstate parameter:
CASE ( nspin == 1 ):
    Provide one up to 2l+1 (e.g., 5 for a d-shell) eigenstate indices varying
    between 1 and 2l+1.
    These values correspond to the m-th eigenstate(s) of the shell occupancy
    matrix, to be targeted by Hubbard U corrections (see PW/examples/example15).
    Example:
        HUBBARD (ortho-atomic)
        U Mn-3d 4.70  3 4 5
        U Ni-3d 3.50  1 2
CASE ( nspin == 2 ):
    Provide one up to 2*(2l+1) (e.g., 10 for a d-shell) eigenstate indices varying
    between 1 and 2*(2l+1). These values correspond to the m-th eigenstate(s) of
    the shell collinear occupancy matrix, to be targeted by Hubbard U corrections.
    Indices from 1 to 2l+1 target spin-up eigenstates, while those from (2l+2)
    to 2*(2l+1) target the  spin-down ones (see PW/examples/example16).
    Example:
        HUBBARD (ortho-atomic)
        U Mn-3d 4.70  3 4 5 8 9 10
        U Ni-3d 3.50  1 2 6 7
CASE ( noncolin = .true. ):
    Provide one up to 2*(2l+1) (e.g., 10 for a d-shell) eigenstate indices varying
    between 1 and 2*(2l+1). These values correspond to the m-th eigenstate(s) of
    the noncollinear occupancy matrix of the shell, to be targeted by Hubbard U
    corrections.
    Example:
        HUBBARD (ortho-atomic)
        U Mn-3d 4.70  3 4 5 8 9 10
        U Ni-3d 3.50  1 2 6 7

Remark: specs of (orbital-resolved) ALPHA parameters are optional
ALPHA is the perturbation used to compute U with the orbital-resolved
linear-response method of Macke et al., arXiv:2312.13580 (2023), based on
Cococcioni and de Gironcoli, PRB 71, 035105 (2005).
Syntax of the line:
ALPHA label-shell alpha_val eigenstate(1) [... eigenstate(m)]
Where:
ALPHA         = string constant "ALPHA"; indicates that specs for an ALPHA parameter will be given
label         = label of the atom (as defined in ATOMIC_SPECIES)
shell         = specs of the nl-subshell (e.g., 3d, 2p...)
alpha_val     = value of the ALPHA parameter (in eV)
eigenstate(m) = index/indices of the m-th eigenstate(s) belonging to the shell
                   that will be targeted by ALPHA (same syntax as for orbital-resolved
                   Hubbard U)
